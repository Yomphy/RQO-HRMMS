This project contains multiple Python scripts. The key functionalities provided by the scripts are:

1. **motion_class.ipynb**: Motion classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
2. **adaptiveFilters.py**: A script for strong random noise cancellation using adaptive filters based on Affine Projection.
3. **SpectralSubtraction.py**: A method for strong periodic noise cancellation using enhanced spectral subtraction.
4. **RQO.py**: Implementation of the Rayleigh Quotient Optimization (RQO) algorithm for weak nosie.
5. **HMM.py**: Implementation of Heart Rate Trajectory Tracking Based on HMM.
